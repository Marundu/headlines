# headlines
Headlines app from Flask By Example

Run `python headlines.py` from a terminal.

Suggested Improvements

- Create a drop-down for the list of feeds,
- Add feeds and their descriptions via text boxes, then add these to a database, instead of hardcoding them.
- Shuffle the feeds' contents to keep the reading interesting,
